# MyAutoGPTContainer

Becoming familiar with VS Code with Containers.  This exercise follows the YouTube talk by DanCanCode called: [My Favorite Way To Handle Dev Environments | VS Code Devcontainers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDa3v4Quj7Y)

Once the container is setup, I will get the files for the [Significant-Gravitas / Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT) repository from GitHub and work through the examples.  The reason for this is when I first tried cloning and running the project, it was unable to build the container, and while trying to figure out what the problem was, I realised that I needed to become much more familiar with the nuts and bolts of setting up and using containers for customised build environments in VS Code.
